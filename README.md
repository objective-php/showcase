# Objective PHP / Showcase

## Project topic

This project provides a "fully" functionnal application based on Objective PHP Framework. It mainly contains components demos.

This is the place to start until we provide an actual documentation.

## How to make it work

First, note that Objective PH needs **PHP 7** to run. It's also meant to run under a Unix like system (GNU/Linux, OS X..).

A few simple steps are needed to get this application up and running:

```
git clone https://github.com/objective-php/showcase
cd showcase

# the next step assumes that composer is available in your PATH
composer install

# and this one requires [Bower](https://bowerjs.io)
bower install

# finally, lauch PHP's embedded web server 
./serve.sh
```

You can then open http://localhost:8001 to access live demo of Objective PHP Framework. Note that the frmaework will show itself much more efficient when using a production grade web server (as Apache or Nginx), while the PHP built-in server will allow you to make the demo running within seconds.

## Add support for Doctrine demos

If you want to be able to run the Doctrine related demos, you'll need a copy of our DB (which is largely based on [MySQL "employees"](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/employees-introduction.html) database).

You can download our copy of this database from [objective-php.org](http://objective-php.org/employees.sql.gz).

After importing the "employees" (default name) database, you can either create a "demo" user with no password and access to "employees" database, or alter the default configuration located in "app/config/doctrine.php":

```
    'user'          => 'demo',
    'password'      => '',
```
